# Arduino AC motor regulator

This project is based on the Arduino UNO R3 which is used as a signal generator for a TRIAC that regulates the power of an AC motor.
The microcontorller takes in data from the readings of a pressure sensor and maintains the pressure at a given setpoint using PID regulation.
The AC motor in question is the fan of a HEPA filter that provides the airflow and creates differential pressure in the closed clean environment.
This project is in prototype phase.
